# Predicting Insurance Premium

Made a systematic comparison of supervised learning models for predicting the future medical expenses of individuals

Models:
1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge
3. Lasso
4. XGB
5. Gradient boosting
7. Decision tree
8. Random Forest
9. Neural network

Result: Random forest and Gradient boosting provided the best predictions with the accuracy around 0.82. I'm still trying to develop ab better NN model
